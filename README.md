### Ensure a git repo exists on disk and that it's up-to-date

## Install

```
npm install git-pull-or-clone
```

## Usage

```js
const gitPullOrClone = require('git-pull-or-clone')

  if (err) throw err
  console.log('SUCCESS!')
})
```

## API

### `gitPullOrClone(url, outPath[, options], callback)`

Ensure a git repo exists on disk and that it's up-to-date.

Clones the git repo specified by `url` to the path `outPath`. If the repo already exists on disk,
then a pull is performed to update the repo instead.

The git repo is shallowly cloned by default. To make a complete clone, set `options.depth` to `Infinity`. If the git repo was previously cloned shallowly, it remains shallow.

When the operation is finished, `callback` is called. The first argument to `callback` is either
`null` or an `Error` object if an error occurred.

### `gitPullOrClone.async(url, outPath[, options])`

Work as same as `gitPullOrClone(url, outPath[, options], callback)` but handle callback as async function
